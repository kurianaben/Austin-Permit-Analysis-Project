# Data Analysis Project - Economic Trends vs Building Permits in Austin, TX

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and report building using Excel and PowerBI. The original downloaded dataset thatâ€™s used as the basis for this project includes residential & commercial permit applications for Austin, TX. Other variables included in this project include 30-year mortgage rates, prime rates, inflation rates, the Consumer Confidence Index, recession indicator, & the Austin, TX, unemployment rate.

This project was done to see what correlation, if any, there was with the amount of building permits (both residential & commercial) the residents of Austin, TX, applied for and the general economic conditions of the US during the same time period for the years of 2009 to 2024.

The reason I decided to do this particular project was because I love learning about the real estate industry and thought that there might be some interesting information and correlations that most people like myself have not seen. I chose Austin, TX, for the city in this project simply because I like the city. Loosely speaking, however, I believe similar trends can be found if this project was replicated with any other city.
